phuild is a tool to help distribute PHP scripts along with necessary components.

phuild determines which classes a script needs and will either generate a
list of require_once-statements (for your convenience during development) or
just create a new version of the script which contains all necessary classes, so
that the user has to bother only about one script instead of a whole library
of classes.

Usage:

./phuild.php <script> > <complete script file>

Please note that phuild doesn't support namespaces.
